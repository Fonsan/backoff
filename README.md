# Backoff

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/backoff`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'backoff'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install backoff

## Usage

```ruby
require 'backoff'
require 'logger'
logger = Logger.new($stderr)
class Foo
  class MyError < StandardError; end
  class MyErrorTwo < StandardError; end
  def bar
    raise MyError if rand < 0.3
    raise MyErrorTwo if rand < 0.1
    true
  end
end
# The second argument may be a exception class or a list of exception classes
foo_with_backoff = Backoff.wrap(Foo.new, [Foo::MyError, Foo::MyErrorTwo], logger, initial_backoff: 1, multiplier: 2)
p foo_with_backoff.bar

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
